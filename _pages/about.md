About me 
------
I'm a 23 year old developer, graduated in 2023 in CS. Currently working as a consultant I matured a strong interest towards game developing while I was approaching the very end of my academic career, I started with simple projects in Unity and then I switched to Unreal Engine in order to gain further knowledge and to face more difficult challenges.


Unity
------
The very start consisted of relatively small tasks such as adding small features or fixing broken code in the provided projects by Unity itself. Thereafter I started my "major" project, a top down RPG, I spent quite a while (approximately 7/9 months) developing this game.

I explored a lot of concepts regarding an RPG, my intention was serious about it and I genuinely wanted to release it but it lacked of environments and I wasn't really into scene building but rather developing technical aspects. I was greatly inspired by *Metin2* when developing this game.

These are some of the features that I was able to implement in the game:
1. **Character creation**: it wasn't bone oriented (such as deforming/manipulating bones) but rather choice oriented, i.e. selecting hair, eyebrows, type of face etc.. and also adjusting the color based on your likings. After the customization the player is prompted to choose the class of your character between warrior, mage and ninja.
1. **Skill system**: I implemented a simple skill tree, it consisted of single target, area of effect and buff skills. In order to get ahold of the powerful skills the player had to unlock the previous ones, hence why it's called a skill tree.
1. **Crafting system**: the user could talk to the blacksmith and upgrade the weapons to a certain point, after which the weapon would evolve to a powerful one with better stats. Or you could craft it from scratch but at a higher prices and number of materials.
1. **Quest & Dialogue**: I actually used a wonderful plugin so I didn't make this from scratch, but it was helpful in order to read the documentation and explore every aspect of the plugin.
1. **Item stats**: every item was filled with stats for the solely purpose of powering the player, plus every item required a certain class in order to be worn. Every piece of equipment (armor and weapons) had their own effect based on the rarity. Moreover they provided a special status effect applied to the enemy only if the criteria met the requirements in order to be triggerable.
1. **Save system**: I made this from scratch, very basic save system, nothing complex.
1. **Classic RPG features**: looting, killing mobs, experience system (following Runescape's method), skill slot, chests and so on.

Unreal Engine
------
After spending a while on Unity I eventually decided to switch to UE since I found out it was more industry oriented, I came to the conclusion that Unity was a good engine for indie/2D games and it does a good job about it.
